                        <p>It’s easy and understandable for people to fall into a cooking rut at any time. They know what they like and what they can make well enough. Life gets busy, so they stick to a rotation of the tried and true.</p>
                        <p>Cooking, and food in general, should be fun, but when you’re stuck in a cooking rut, it can become a task you dread rather than look forward to.</p>

                        <p>Personally, a renewed interest in cooking has been one of the few bright spots during this pandemic quarantine. A well-cooked meal can ease the sting of not being able to visit your favorite restaurants or transport you to far away destinations that you can currently only dream about visiting again someday.</p>

                            <p>The goal of The Once a Week Chef is to inspire home cooks to try something new once a week for a whole year by giving them a weekly theme and prompt on which to base a recipe and a place to document their dishes. At the end of their year long challenge, users will have 52 new tried and tested recipes and the satisfaction of having tried something out of their comfort zone for a whole year.</p>

                        <p>Branding was a critical first step in setting the tone of my project. I began the process by creating a moodboard to establish a style I was hoping to achieve.</p>

                    <div class="branding-text">
                        <p>From there, I explored type choices that would give me the fun and whimsical, hand-drawn vibe I was looking for. I compiled a few that were appealing to me, then started sketching out
                            some logo options utilizing them.</p>

                    <div class="branding-text">
                        <p>The ideal type treatment became clear, but preferences on the logo options were mixed. After several rounds of revisions and feedback, I finally settled on a logo that provides a strong idea of the brand and gives direction for the styling of the book to come.</p>
