                <p>It’s easy and understandable for people to fall into a cooking rut at any time. They know what they like and what they can make well enough. Life gets busy, so they stick to a rotation of the tried and true.</p>
                <p>I believe cooking, and food in general, should be fun. Personally, a renewed interest in cooking has been one of the few bright spots during this pandemic quarantine. A well-cooked meal can ease the sting of not being able to visit your favorite restaurants or transport you to far away destinations that you can currently only dream about visiting
                again someday. But when you’re stuck in a cooking rut, it can become a task you dread rather than look forward to.</p>
                <p>The goal of The Once a Week Chef is to inspire home cooks to try something new once a week for a whole year by giving them a weekly theme and prompt on which to base a recipe and a place to document their dishes. At the end of their year long challenge, users will have a personally curated cookbook of tried-and-tested recipes and the
                satisfaction of having tried something out of their comfort zone 52 weeks straight.</p>
